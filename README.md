# ROB501 Labs
Lab work for ROB501 (Computer Vision for Robotics). Project code is written in Python, and some code skeletons and helper functions written by the ROB501 teaching team.

Lab #1: Applied Image Homography
- templates
  - dlt_homography.py: Finds optimal coordinate transform between two images based on point correspondences using the DLT homography algorithm.
  - bilinear_interp.py: Rasterizes image warped by a homography by performing bilinear interpolation on pixels.
  - alpha_blend.py: Overlays warped image onto background image with a degree of translucency using alpha blending.
  - terrain_overlay.py: Uses image homography and alpha blending to display terrain obstacle map onto input camera imagery from a mobile rover.

Lab #2:
